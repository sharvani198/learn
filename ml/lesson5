Underfitting - high bias - or when the model does not fitt the train data very well and is too general.
Overfitting - high variance -  or when the model fits the training set very well but does not generalize well on real data.

Sometimes overfitting may happen due to too many features. 
In that case we can introdruce an extra cost on some of the weights. This regularization parameter determines how much the costs of our weight parameters are inflated.

Another popular algorithm to use to find weights is the Normal Equation.
