What is machine learning?

Multiple definitions - 
1. A set of methods that can detect patterns in some data and use the patterns to make predictions about other data. - Kevin Murphy book.
2. Is a science of getting machines to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Andrew Ng course - Arthur Samuel
3. A machine is said to learn from experience E wrt a task T if its performance P on task T improves with experience E. - Wikipedia - Tom Mitchell, CMU

Supervised Learning (predictive)
Goal is to find a mapping between input A to output B (test set) given a labeled set(training set) of input-output pairs.
1. Classification problem  : when the output B is a discrete/categorical value (yes/no, 1/2/3)
2. Regression problem : when the output B is a continuous/real-valued value(0-100%, <=Rs. 7000)

Unsupervised Learning (descriptive)
Goal is to find patterns in a unlabeled data set X.
Clustering: find clusters of data that are similar in some way.

Reinforcement Learning
Goal is to find the right answer/behaviour while being given occasional rewards/punishments.
