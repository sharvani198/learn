Classification

Binary or multi class

Linear regression will not give good predictions for classification problems. As we want y` to be one of the classes use logistic regresion instead.

Logistic Regression 
  Apply the sigmoid function(logistic function) to the value of linear regression to get binary value
  so y` = f(wx+b)
    where f(x) = 1/(1+e^-x) is the sigmoid function
          y` is the probability of y=1
     
Basically the vale of linear regression , a linear equation, will represent the decision boundary for the classification. 
A sigmoid, or an other similar fucntion. just converts the real valued prediction into a discrate class value.
Note: the decision boundary can become non linear when the regression function is non linear.

Cost Function

 Cost = { -log(y`)     if y=1
        { -log(1-y`)   if y=0
 Cost = -ylog(y`) - (1-y`)log(1-y`)
 
 Multiclass
 
 one-vs-all method of splitting the multiple classes into pairs and use binary classification on each. So we'll get multiple logictic regression functions.
